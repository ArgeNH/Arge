# Arge Niño 🌌

Welcome to my **personal page**

I am an engineering student, wanting to learn about web development. 👨🏻‍💻
I am studying Systems and Computing Engineering at the Technological and Pedagogical University of Colombia. I am currently in seventh semester.

I am 21 years old. I really like watching anime, playing video games 👾 and the cats, for now I have 3 of them. 🐱

This is my first personal website, I hope to improve it with the skills I gain in the short and long term.
